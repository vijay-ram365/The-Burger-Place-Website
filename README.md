# The-Burger-Place-Website

HTML and CSS principles

In this website, I had decided to create a mock up of a burger restaurant/fast-food location to demonstrate HTML and CSS markup.

The HTML is designed to show HTML structure with links, images, icons, and a map.
The CSS is designed to show basic styling, responsive design for mobile and large screens, and use of media queries.
